                    Charminar was built to acknowledge the elimination of the plague which had affected
                     the entire city immensely during that era. It is believed that the Sultan had 
                     prayed for the end of this plague with which his people were suffering.

                     ( r. 1628â€“1658) to house the tomb of his favourite wife, Mumtaz Mahal; 
                     it also houses the tomb of Shah Jahan himself.

                    While worship forms a key tenet of the House of Worship, 
                    service to humanity is considered an outward expression of the inner 
                    transformation that worship brings about. This service is expressed through 
                    deeds carried out in the spirit of service for the betterment of humanity; 
                    communal worship in homes, neighborhoods and villages; an educational process 
                    that builds the capacity of individuals to serve others; and, through a pattern 
                    of community life embodying the principle of the oneness of humanity.
